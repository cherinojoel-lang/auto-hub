 * ⚡ Bolt Optimization:
 * Combined multiple chained .filter() calls into a single pass.
 *
 * Why: The previous implementation iterated over the vehicle array 6 times
 * and allocated 5 intermediate arrays in memory.
 * Impact: Reduces array iterations from O(6n) to O(n) and minimizes memory
 * allocations, especially noticeable with large vehicle datasets.
