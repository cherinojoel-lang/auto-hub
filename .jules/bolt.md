## 2024-05-15 - [Initial setup]
**Learning:** Checking the codebase to see how images are loaded. Noticed that the custom Image and WixImage components in src/components/ui/image.tsx default to loading="lazy" based on typical browser behavior if not specified, but the memo says we need explicit eager loading for above-the-fold images.
**Action:** Always check the memory directives. For above the fold hero images, we should explicitly pass loading="eager".
## 2024-05-15 - [LCP Optimization]
**Learning:** The custom `<Image>` component implicitly defaults to `loading="lazy"` via browser defaults unless overridden. This delays rendering for critical above-the-fold assets, negatively impacting LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).
**Action:** Always add `loading="eager"` and `fetchPriority="high"` to hero images and other above-the-fold images to optimize LCP.
## 2024-05-22 - [LCP Anti-Pattern in Detail Views]
**Learning:** Found that the main vehicle image on the `VehicleDetailPage` was wrapped in an `AnimatedElement`, causing it to wait for JS execution before appearing, artificially delaying the LCP.
**Action:** Never wrap above-the-fold main images in intersection-observer-based fade-in wrappers. Ensure they render immediately.
